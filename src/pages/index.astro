      title="Solatrix™ Fractional Thermo-mechanical Device"
      img="solatrix"
      date="2020-Now"
    >
      Solatrix is a fractional thermo-mechanical device that has a significant
      effect on the rejuvenation and removal of skin lesions by transferring
      direct heat to the skin. The high-temperature (400°C) titanium tip of the
      device transfers heat to the skin with extremely low invasion; and by
      stimulating collagen production, it causes rejuvenation and eliminates
      wrinkles. The heat can be controlled by the contact time of the tip with
      the skin and the penetration depth of the tip

      url="https://mersateb.com/en/madamx"
      date="2018"
    >
      The Firebolt plasma device transfers high-frequency plasma energy to the
      skin. This energy is used in various treatments such as blepharoplasty and
      the removal of moles, freckles, and wrinkles. The released energy
      generates a heating action on the skin surface that removes the old,
      damaged epidermis and dermis cells, thus triggering collagen creation. The
      exclusive features of the Firebolt plasma device are its high safety,
      various treatment indications, and its therapeutic performance without
      side effects.

    <CardProject
      title="Nettle™ Fractional RF Device"
      img="nettle"
      url="https://mersateb.com/en/nettle"
      date="2018"
    >
      The fractional RF technology applies high-frequency and
      minimally-intrusive radio waves to specific skin layers to produce heat,
      which stimulates fibroblasts and produces collagen and elastin.
      Ultimately, this process significantly contributes to skin rejuvenation.
      Fractional RF applies radio waves to the skin with fractional needles and
      can produce different effects in the skin’s lower layers without exposing
      the skin surface to heat; thus, significantly reducing treatment side
      effects.

      title="Hurricane™ Carboxytherapy Device"
      img="hurricane"
      url="https://mersateb.com/en/hurricane"
      date="2019"
    >
      The device starts a series of interconnected reactions after controlled
      and continuous injections of CO2 and leads to some changes like
      vasodilation, an increase in blood flow, and an increase in body
      temperature. The blood flow increase leads to the oxygenation of the
      intended area which itself helps the metabolism increase, tissue
      rejuvenation, and detoxification and it finally causes rejuvenation and
      cellulitis decrease in the intended tissue.
